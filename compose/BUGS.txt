When you try and start for a second time you see this:

irods-db_1       | LOG:  database system was shut down at 2016-08-22 16:59:03 UTC
irods-db_1       | LOG:  MultiXact member wraparound protections are now enabled
irods-db_1       | LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
irods-db_1       | LOG:  autovacuum launcher started
irods-icat       | >>>bootstrap.sh
irods-icat       | Wait for DB server to be ready
irods-icat       | waitforit.sh: waiting 15 seconds for irods-db:5432
irods-db_1       | LOG:  incomplete startup packet
irods-icat       | waitforit.sh: irods-db:5432 is available after 0 seconds
irods-icat       | error: failed switching to "irods": Unable to find user irods


I think the autovacuum is causing problems- taking too long. It somehow has a port open already, causing the waitforit.sh to complete too soon.

And then the irods user not being available: this user is created in the image at image build time, I believe. Something needs to happen to keep this
user in-sync between restarts.
